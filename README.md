## Game Summary

One day, a ufo crashed into a planet conquered by a species of rabbits. Two Elos, name of the alien race, popped up from the ufo and took a gander of the landscape and thought it was the most beautiful scenery they have ever seen, and a place they want to conquer themselves. The two Elos immediately called the other Elos from their mothership out in space, and soon, multiple ufo ships came rushing down to the land of the rabbits to invade and take over the planet. Many rabbits were escaping from them, feeling petrified, trying their best to defend themselves. Unfortunately, the planet was fully taken over by the Elos and the rabbits were incarcerated. But one rabbit, who many said was eccentric, managed to hide from the Elos because he lived in a house that was far away from the rabbit civilization. This rabbit’s name is Jack. Two Elos broke into his house and tried to catch him. Jack resisted by fighting back and suddenly knocked the two Elos out. Jack looked down at them and found a ray gun that was held by one of them. Jack wasn’t going to let his people be vanquished and imprisoned by the Elos, and decided to take matters into his own hands. There, Jack would begin his mission to take out the invaders who took over his home, defeat their queen, and rescue and save his people.
